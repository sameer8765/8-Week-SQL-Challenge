----------------------------------------------- D. OUT OF THE BOX QUESTIONS -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------- I DID ALL CALCULATION FOR 2020 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

with revenue_2020_cte as
(select month(start_date) as month, sum(price) as revenue
from subscriptions s join plans p on s.plan_id = p.plan_id
where year(start_date) = 2020
group by month
order by month)

select month, revenue,
(revenue-LAG(revenue) OVER(ORDER BY month))/revenue AS revenue_growth
from revenue_2020_cte;

2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?

  * Monthly revenue growth: How does Foodie-Fi's revenue increase or decrease by monthly? Are there any months that the number of customers 
    increasing significantly?
  * Customers growth: How many customers increase by monthly? How does the rate look like (x1.5, x2,... after each month)?  
  * Conversion rate: How many customers keep using Foodie-Fi after trial? How does the rate look like (x1.5, x2,...after each month)?
  * Churn rate: How many customers cancel the subscription by monthly? What plan they has used?
  
3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?

  * Customers who downgraded their plan
  * Customers who upgraded from basic monthly to pro monthly or pro annual
  * Customers who cancelled the subscription
  
4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include
   in the survey? What is the primary reason for the cancellation?
   
  * Price
  * Techinical issues
  * Customer support
  * Found an alternative
  * Others (please specify)
  
how satisfied were you with the subscription? (Likert scale: Very Satisfied - Very Unsatisfied)
Would you consider using our services in the future? (Likert scale: Very Satisfied - Very Unsatisfied)
Would you recommend our company to a colleague, friend or family member? (Likert scale: Very Satisfied - Very Unsatisfied)

5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?

From the exit survey, look for the most common reasons why customers cancelled the subscription

  * Price: increase the number of discounts in some seasons of a year, extend the trial time, or add more benefits to customers
  * Service quality: work with the relevant department to fix the issue
  * Found an alternative: do some competitor analysis to see their competitive advantages over us
  
To validate the effectiveness of those ideas, check:

  * Churn rate
  * Conversion rate
